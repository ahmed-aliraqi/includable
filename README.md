## Includable 

This Package provides a simple way to load a model relation by require it in the request,
You must identify the relation you wish to be included if you require it in the request  

### Installation 

Install the package via Composer:
````
$ composer require khaled-dev/includable
````

### Usage

first use the trait in model:

````
namespace App;

use Khaled7\Includable\Includable;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{   
    use Includable;
    
    /**
     * The attributes that are includable,
     * references to a relations method.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $includable = [
        'posts',
        'votes',
    ];
   
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    } 
    
    public function votes()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Vote::class);
    }
    
    // Not includable, coz not in $includable
    public function subscribes()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Subscribe::class);
    }  
}
```` 

In controller:

````
// Use to load all includable of all users
User::withRequestIncludes()->get()

// Use to load the includable of this instance
$user = User::first()
$user->loadRequestIncludes();
````

In Request:
````
localhost:8000/users?includes=posts,votes
````
 
 > In result it should help you to  only include the relations if you really need it, and usually use in APIs.
